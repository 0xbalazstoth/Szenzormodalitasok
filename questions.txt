Essay Topic - Complex questions
  Can contain 4/5 sub-questions, these sub-questions are helpers to answer all the topics within the topic. 
  The points are calculated how broad and deep your knowlege is in the topic.
  (The sub-questions just tries to help, this is the MINIMUM! Write more if you want to be on the safe side...). NOT only 1-2 senstences, long explanation needed!
